Booleans, Comparison Operators, and Logical Operators

The bool data type holds one of the values True or False, which are often encoded as 1 or 0, respectively.

There are 6 comparison operators that are common to see in order to obtain a bool value:

Comparison Operators
Symbol Use Case	Bool	Operation
5 < 3	False	Less Than
5 > 3	True	Greater Than
3 <= 3	True	Less Than or Equal To
3 >= 5	False	Greater Than or Equal To
3 == 5	False	Equal To
3 != 5	True	Not Equal To

there are three logical operators you need to be familiar with:
   
Logical Use   	   Bool	       Operation
5 < 3 and 5 == 5   False	   and - Evaluates if all provided statements are True
5 < 3 or 5 == 5	   True        or - Evaluates if at least one of many statements is True
not 5 < 3	       True	       not - Flips the Bool Value
