Besides writing variable names that are descriptive, there are a few things to watch out for when naming variables in Python.

Only use ordinary letters, numbers and underscores in your variable names. They can’t have spaces, and need to start with a letter or underscore.

You can’t use reserved words or built-in identifiers that have important purposes in Python, which you’ll learn about throughout this course. A list of Python reserved words is can be found in the Python documetation. See Lexical analysis - Keywords(opens in a new tab). Creating names that are descriptive of the values often will help you avoid using any of these words. A quick table of these words is also available below.
